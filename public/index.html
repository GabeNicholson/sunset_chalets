            <p>Welcome to Ocean Sunset Chalets, your oasis for authentic, coastal experiences in rural Nova Scotia.
                Located
                in
                Marshville, just a stone’s throw from the Northumberland Strait and Murray Beach, our six,
                well-appointed
                chalets offer the very best in East Coast hospitality.</p>
            <p>Murray Beach, famed for its dramatic ocean tides, boasts the warmest waters north of the Carolinas.
                Beneath a
                fiery sunset, stroll out for more than a kilometre and comb the sandbars for seashells. During the day,
                take
                relaxing strolls on the beach, explore the surrounding areas , or simply watch the world drift by. Enjoy
                badminton and other games and roast marshmallows at the bonfire on property.</p>
            <p>Open all-year round, our chalets are only 1.5-hours from historic Halifax and just 15 minutes from
                charming
                Tatamagouche. Beyond the beach, enjoy world-class golf, whale watching, provincial parks, shopping,
                dining,
                fishing and fresh seafood, museums and wineries, breweries and distilleries. </p>
            <p>It’s time for new memories. Whether it is family reunion, wedding and small getaway, contact our team to
                plan
                your Nova Scotia escape.</p>
